##  10.4.1 What is a list derivation? 

List comprehension, also known as list parsing. List parsing, as the name suggests, is to parse a new list from an existing iterable object. 

>  Iterables we have learned so far are strings and lists. Iterables can be iterated through in a loop. During the iteration of the elements in the iterable, we can process the elements to generate a new list. 

Before explaining the basic structure of list derivations, students will first look at a piece of code that adds new elements to the list in a for loop: 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
In the above code, we determine whether the current element is odd in the loop, and if it is odd, add it to the list. To simplify the generation code of the list, we can use the list parser: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
List comprehensions are more concise and elegant than adding elements directly using for loops. Now let's go into detail about list comprehensions in Python. 

##  Basic structure of 10.4.2 list derivation 

The basic structure of a list derivation is as follows: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
The element represents the element traversed from the iterable object iterable. From its basic structure, it can be seen that the list derivation is essentially a for loop. Each iteration in the for loop inserts a new element into the list. 

>  The iterable objects we have learned so far are strings and lists. We will now create a new list based on these two iterable objects. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
The basic structure of a list derivation is simple. We now extend it with nested for loops and conditional control structures. 

##  Complex structure 10.4.3 list derivation 

List derivation containing nested for loops 

The grammatical structure is as follows: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
Element represents a new element generated by elements x and y. iterable represents an iterable object. For ease of understanding, we can transform a list derivation with a nested for loop into a normal loop structure: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
(2) List derivations containing conditional controls 

The grammatical structure is as follows: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
Element is an element that is traversed from the iterable object iterable, and then logically judged by the if statement. If the element meets the conditions, it is added to the list. Also for ease of understanding, we can convert the list derivation containing conditional controls into a normal loop structure: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
Code example:

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
(3) Complex list derivations with both nested for loops and conditional controls 

We can use both nested for loops and conditional controls in list derivations to combine them into more complex list derivations. 

Look directly at the code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
When students understand the list derivation, they can convert it into an ordinary loop structure for understanding. The complex list derivation in the above text is taken as an example, and the corresponding ordinary for loop code is: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
Code example - Calculate all prime numbers between 0 and 100: 

Python

 ```

##  11.1.1 understand tuple types 

Tuples have the same data structure as lists, except that tuples are static data types, while lists are dynamic data types. The differences between tuples and lists are explained in detail in Section 11.4. The tuple type in Python is a set of data enclosed by the () symbol, and the elements in the set are separated by commas. Like lists, tuples can contain any data type: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574532615
 ```  
![avatar]( 922a41b52acf9ff7b468765142711036.png) 

Tuples, like lists and strings, are a linear sequential table structure. 

![avatar]( cb17f02bb5eb01f87c08bb03dd9e0f7f.png) 

>  Students who are not familiar with linear sequential table structures can review the content of Section 9.1, "Basic Concepts of Strings". 

In a linear sequence structure, elements in a data set can be accessed by indexing: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574532615
 ```  
Indexes in Python are numbered from 0, 0 for the first position, and 1 for the second position. Python also supports negative indices, which are numbered from -1, -1 for the penultimate position, -2 for the penultimate position, and so on. 

##  Type name of 11.1.2 tuple 

In interactive mode, type to output the type name of a string: 

>  >>> container = (1, '2', 3.0, True)

> >> type(container)

<class 'tuple'> 

From the output, the type of the tuple is named tuple. 

##  Definition of 11.1.3 tuple 

The definition of tuples mainly includes object definition method and direct definition method. 

(1) Object definition method 

The type name of the tuple is tuple. You can directly execute help (tuple) in interactive mode to find the definition and usage of tuple: 

>  class tuple(object)

|  tuple(iterable=(), /)

|

|  Built-in immutable sequence.

|

|  If no argument is given, the constructor returns an empty tuple.

|  If iterable is specified the tuple is initialized from iterable's items.

|

|  If the argument is a tuple, the return value is the same object. 

In the output of the interactive mode, the form of tuple (iterable = (),/) is the object definition method. The parameter iterable represents an iterable object. Among the data types learned so far, string, list, and tuple are all iterable objects. In Python, any data type that can traverse the elements in the collection is an iterable object. The so-called traversal is to access the elements in the collection one by one. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574532615
 ```  
(2) Direct definition method 

The so-called direct definition method is to define tuples directly through the () symbol: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574532615
 ```  
List types can contain any data type, and now nested tuples are defined by direct definition. The so-called nested tuple refers to the inclusion of tuples in tuples. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574532615
 ```  
When defining a tuple, you can also directly remove (), and Python will automatically treat a comma-separated element as a tuple. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574532615
 ```  
##  10.1.4 unpacking of tuples 

When assigning a tuple to another variable, Python automatically unpacks the tuple. To understand the concept of unpacking, let's take a look at a simple code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574532615
 ```  
Code explanation: 

>  (1) Tuple unpacking is to disassemble the tuple and then assign the elements in the tuple in sequence

(2) In the code a, b, c = container, assign the elements of the tuple container to the variables on the left in order 

When unpacking a tuple, the number of variables on the left side of the assignment operator must match the number of elements in the tuple, otherwise an exception will be thrown. 

How to unpack a tuple when there is only one element? 

Code example: 

Python

 ```  
##  11.1.4 Traverse Iterable Objects 

The simple data types in Python are all non-iterable objects. The simple data types learned so far are integers, floating-point types, and boolean types. Composite data types in Python are all iterable objects. For iterable objects, you can iterate over the elements in the collection in the for loop structure. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574532615
 ```  
##  11.1.5 Knowledge points in this section 

>  (1) A tuple type is a collection of data that arranges the elements in the collection in order

(2) In Python, the tuple type is surrounded by (), and the elements in () are separated by English commas

(3) The type name of a tuple is tuple. Like strings and lists, tuples are also linear sequence structures

(4) Tuples can be defined by object definition and direct definition

(5) Simple data types are non-iterable, and composite data types in Python are all iterable objects

(6) For iterable objects, you can iterate through the elements in the collection in a for loop

##  Common Operators 11.2.1 Tuples 

A tuple type is an abstract data type that defines how to operate on a data type. In this section, we focus on manipulating tuples through operators. 

![avatar]( 8f7c318a31a2c57c94790e31edfe50f1.png) 

The commonly used operators for tuple types are shown in the following table: 

![avatar]( 457c64d99904af3193690b9bcfad55b1.png) 

##  11.2.2 [] operator: index access tuple 

In Section 9.2, we introduced how to access the characters in a string by indexing. The tuple type is also a linear sequence structure, and like a string, the elements in the tuple can be accessed by indexing. 

Operation syntax: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574540265
 ```  
Tuple and string are static data types, which can only be read by indexing characters and cannot be modified. The list type can be modified by indexing elements. 

>  Indexes in Python are divided into positive and negative indices. Positive indices are numbered from 0 and represent the first element in the data set. Negative indices are numbered from -1 and represent the first to last element in the data set. Positive and negative index values must be within a valid range or an out-of-bounds access error message will be thrown. Students who are not familiar with this can review the content in Section 9.2. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574540265
 ```  
##  11.2.3 [:] operator: slice of tuple 

The trimming operation syntax is the same as the slicing operation of string. For students who are not very familiar with this, please review the content in Section 9.2. After slicing a tuple, a new tuple is returned. 

Operation syntax:

 ```  
##  11.2.4 + operator: tuple addition 

Tuple addition is the process of combining elements from two tuples into a new tuple. 

Operation syntax: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574540265

 ```  
##  11.2.5 * operator: multiplication of tuples 

The "*" operator is used to repeat the output of the tuple and return a new list. 

Operation syntax: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574540265
 ```  
The parameter number must be an integer number. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python

 ```  
##  Relational Operations 11.2.6 Tuples 

Use relational operators to perform relational operations on tuples and return a result of type Boolean. The relational operations of tuples are the same as the relational operations of lists. 

Operation syntax: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574540265
 ```  
Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574540265
 ```  
The relationship operation of tuples is compared in order. The order comparison here starts from the first element of the tuple and is compared element by element. Only if the element values are the same and the order is the same, the two tuples are equal. Otherwise, the size relationship of the tuples is determined by the size relationship of the elements. 

>  For example, in the code above, although the list right has only one element, the first element in right is greater than the first element in the list left. At this time, Python will directly determine that the tuple right is greater than the tuple left, even if the elements behind the tuple left are larger than the elements in the tuple right. 

Now use the loop structure to determine whether two tuples are equal: 

Python

 ```  
##  11.2.7 in operator: find element 

Use the "in" operator to determine whether the element exists in the tuple, and return a boolean type True if present, or False otherwise. 

Operation syntax: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574540265
 ```  
When indicating whether it does not exist, the logical NOT operator is required.

 ```  
##  11.2.8 knowledge points 

>  (1) A tuple type is a linear sequence structure in which elements in a tuple can be accessed by indexing.

(2) Tuple and string are static data types that can only be read by indexing characters and cannot be modified. List types can be modified by indexing elements.

11.4.1 Immutable Data Types 

11.4.2 Variable Data Types 

Difference 11.4.3 Tuple and List 

11.4.4 knowledge points 

Learn Python 11.4.5 System 

##  11.4.1 Immutable Data Types 

Immutable data types refer to data types that cannot be modified, i.e. read-only. The immutable data types learned so far are string, tuple. 

![avatar]( 5edecbf62dc874a327bac9ea6108a816.png) 

When using the [] operator to modify strings and tuples, Python will throw an exception message with the wrong type, which we can verify in interactive mode: 

>  >>> content = "static data type"

> >> content[0]=S

Traceback (most recent call last):

 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

NameError: name 'S' is not defined

> >> numbers = (1,2,3,4,5)

> >> numbers[0] = 6

Traceback (most recent call last):

 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment 

The Python interpreter throws an exception message for TypeError, which means type error. The reason why it is a type error is easy to understand, because the type string or tuple does not support modifying elements. 

##  11.4.2 Variable Data Types 

The opposite of immutable data types is mutable data types, in which elements in a collection can be modified. Lists, as well as composite data types such as dictionaries, collections, class types, etc. that will be introduced later, are mutable data types. We can also verify this in interactive mode: 

>  >>> numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]

> >> id(numbers)

2749153235976

> >> numbers[0]=6

> >> numbers

[6, 2, 3, 4, 5]

From the output of the interactive mode, it can be analyzed that it can be modified by the [] operator list type. The modified list has the same id value as the modified list, indicating that it is the same list. 

>  Call the built-in id function to get the id value of the object. In CPython, the id value is the memory address. 

##  Difference 11.4.3 Tuple and List 

In scenarios where tuples are used, lists can be used instead, so why define the data type tuples? In the content of this section, the analysis is carried out through two aspects: 

Tuples are static, read-only data types 

The core difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are static and immutable, while lists are dynamic and mutable. When we define variables, we should use tuples if the data object has static, read-only properties, otherwise we should use lists. Take the example of a shopping list in life. In the shopping list, we can modify the list at any time, such as adding a certain item or removing a certain item from the shopping cart. The shopping list is modifiable, dynamic, and now simulated through Python code:

 ```  
There are seven days in a week, from Monday to Sunday, and no other time units are included. At this time, it is very natural to use tuples to define all the times of the week:

 ```  
Since lists are mutable data types, they can be modified at any time in the program. 

Python

 ```  
The time of the week includes the eighth day, which is obviously not in line with daily logic. Using tuples can avoid such problems. Once the tuple is modified, Python will throw an exception message with the wrong type. 

(2) Automatic unpacking of tuples 

In Section 11.1, it was mentioned that tuples can be unpacked. With this feature, it is possible to assign values to multiple variables very elegantly. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574590576
 ```  
We will systematically learn functions in Python in later courses. Returning multiple values in a function essentially returns a tuple. Using the automatic unpacking of tuples, variables can be elegantly assigned after a function call. 

##  11.4.4 knowledge points 

>  (1) A static data type refers to a data type that cannot be modified, i.e. read-only. The static data types learned so far are string and tuple.

(2) The opposite of static data types is dynamic data types, which support the modification of elements in a collection. Lists, as well as other composite data types: dictionaries, collections, class types, etc., are all dynamic data types.

11.4.4 knowledge points 

Learn Python 11.4.5 System 

##  11.4.1 Immutable Data Types 

Immutable data types refer to data types that cannot be modified, i.e. read-only. The immutable data types learned so far are string, tuple. 

![avatar]( c1fafd72462d9e8ae821024f7fa45562.png) 

When using the [] operator to modify strings and tuples, Python will throw an exception message with the wrong type, which we can verify in interactive mode: 

>  >>> content = "static data type"

> >> content[0]=S

Traceback (most recent call last):

 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

NameError: name 'S' is not defined

> >> numbers = (1,2,3,4,5)

> >> numbers[0] = 6

Traceback (most recent call last):

 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment 

The Python interpreter throws an exception message for TypeError, which means type error. The reason why it is a type error is easy to understand, because the type string or tuple does not support modifying elements. 

##  11.4.2 Variable Data Types 

The opposite of immutable data types is mutable data types, in which elements in a collection can be modified. Lists, as well as composite data types such as dictionaries, collections, class types, etc. that will be introduced later, are mutable data types. We can also verify this in interactive mode: 

>  >>> numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]

> >> id(numbers)

2749153235976

> >> numbers[0]=6

> >> numbers

[6, 2, 3, 4, 5]

> >> id(numbers)

2749153235976 

From the output of the interactive mode, it can be analyzed that it can be modified by the [] operator list type. The modified list has the same id value as the modified list, indicating that it is the same list. 

>  Call the built-in id function to get the id value of the object. In CPython, the id value is the memory address.

Formatting 12.3.1 string 

12.3.2 formatting using a dictionary 

Advantages and disadvantages of 12.3.3 formatting operation method 

12.3.4 knowledge points 

Learn Python 12.3.5 System 

##  Formatting 12.3.1 string 

In Section 9.4, we introduced string formatting. Let's first review the definition of string formatting and the main formatting methods: 

>  String formatting refers to the output of strings in a specific format. There are two main ways to format strings: one is through the operator%, and the other is through the format method of the string type. 

![avatar]( eb74598d5090d22725082489f96dc229.png) 

In this section, we focus on formatting strings with dictionary types. 

##  12.3.2 formatting using a dictionary 

When using a dictionary for formatting operations, it is mainly formatted by means of keyword placeholders. Here, the keyword placeholder corresponds to the key name in the dictionary, and the key name appears in the string to be formatted. When formatting the string, the Python interpreter automatically replaces the keyword placeholder in the string with the corresponding key value. 

(1) Format with% and dictionary 

Formatting syntax: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574522779
 ```  
The key represents the key name in the dictionary, and the s indicates that the keyword placeholder is formatted as a string type. You can also replace the s with other formatting types, such as d, which is formatted as an integer, and f, which is formatted as a floating-point type. 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574522779
 ```  
The keyword placeholder in the string must be able to match the corresponding key name in the dictionary, otherwise Python will throw an error exception that the key name does not exist, and students can verify it in interactive mode: 

>  "The author of this book is% (author) s " % ({})

Traceback (most recent call last):

 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

KeyError: 'author' 

(2) Format with a dictionary 

1. Pass the dictionary object as a keyword parameter in the format method 

Formatting syntax: 

>  "{param[key]}".format(param=dict) 

The placeholders to be formatted in the string are in the same form as the dictionary and are enclosed in {}. The corresponding key value is output in the form of key name access in {}. In the format method, the dictionary object is passed in the form of keyword parameters. When calling a function in Python, the parameter passing form of name = value is the passing syntax of keyword parameters. 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574522779
 ```  
Similarly, the keyword placeholder in the string must match the corresponding key name in the dictionary, otherwise Python will throw an error exception that the key name does not exist. Students can continue to verify in interactive mode. 

2. Use the ** symbol to unpack the dictionary 

Formatting syntax: 

>  "{key}".format(**dict) 

The key in {} represents the key name in the dictionary. When unpacking the dict with ** in the format method, it will be expanded in format to the form of the keyword argument passed with name = value. Name is the key name in the dictionary, and value is the key value corresponding to the key name. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574522779
 ```  
You can also format a string directly in the form of keyword arguments, achieving the same effect: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574522779
 ```  
##  Advantages and disadvantages of 12.3.3 formatting operation method 

Before explaining the advantages and disadvantages of formatting operations, let's take a few simple examples: formatting through format symbols and dictionary types, respectively. 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574522779
 ```  
When formatting with a format symbol, Python performs type checking, and the data type must be consistent with the type represented by the format symbol or can be implicitly converted to the corresponding data type, otherwise an exception message of type error will be thrown. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574522779

 ```  
When using a dictionary type for formatting operations, there is no type checking, only text substitution, which is more readable than formatting operations. Strings using formatting symbols: 

 ```python

12.4.1 What is pattern matching? 

12.4.2 naive pattern matching algorithm 

Learn Python 12.4.3 System 

##  12.4.1 What is pattern matching? 

Pattern matching is a basic operation of strings in a data structure: given a substring, it is required to find all substrings that are the same as the substring in the main string, which is pattern matching. For a simple example, the main string is "Chinese people do not bully Chinese people", and the substring is "China". The substring here is the pattern to be matched, and finding all the patterns "China" in the main string "Chinese people do not bully Chinese people" is a pattern matching. 

##  12.4.2 naive pattern matching algorithm 

This section aims to implement a very simple naive pattern matching algorithm. Let's first grasp the basic ideas of the naive pattern matching algorithm: 

>  From the first character of the main string, it is compared with the first character of the pattern string. If it is equal, the subsequent comparison of the characters is continued. Otherwise, it is re-compared with the first character of the pattern string from the second character of the main string. This process is repeated until each character in the pattern string is equal to a consecutive character sequence in the main string. At this time, it is called a match success, otherwise the match fails. 

According to the above ideas, we use the Python language to implement the naive pattern matching algorithm of string:

##  13.3.1 key output order 

The underlying implementation of a collection type is based on a hash table, and the order in which keys are output depends on the order in which they are stored in the hash table. 

![avatar]( ee84716de2f888a82a8719b0322d07be.png) 

>  Students who are not familiar with the hash table structure can review the content in 12.4.4 section.

 ```  
From the output of the program, it can be seen that the output order of the keys in the collection is not necessarily the order in which they were defined or inserted. Students can compare the output order of the keys in the dictionary. After Python 3.6, the keys in the dictionary are output in the order in which they were inserted: 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574543774
 ```  
From the output of the program, it can be analyzed that the output order of the keys in the dictionary is consistent with the order of the keys. 

##  13.3.2 key data type 

The data type of the keys in the collection is the same as the data type of the keys in the dictionary, and must be a static, hashable data type. 

>  The static data types I have learned so far are: simple data types, strings, and tuples. 

Why do keys have to be static data types? 

The collection type in Python is also based on a hash table structure. If the key name is static and immutable, then it is guaranteed that the same hash value will be obtained when computed through the hash function. If the key name is a mutable data type, it means that its value changes during the lifetime of the data type, and there is no guarantee that the computed hash value is the same, so the key name must be a static data type to ensure the uniqueness of its hash value. 

##  Quick lookup of 13.3.3 collections 

The collection type is based on a hash table structure, so it can also perform fast lookups. But unlike the dictionary type, there are only keys in the collection, not key values. The collection type is suitable for such application scenarios: it is only used for fast lookups, and there is no need to care about the key value corresponding to the key. When we still need to get the key value, we should use the data structure of the dictionary.

(2) The data type of the key in the collection must be a static data type. The static data types learned so far are: simple data type, string, tuple.

(3) The collection type, like the dictionary type, is a data structure implemented based on a hash table.

14.3.1 understand variable parameters 

14.3.2 operators * and ** 

14.3.3 unpacking arguments 

14.3.4 knowledge points 

Learn Python 14.3.5 System 

##  14.3.1 understand variable parameters 

Variable parameters of a function can be understood from its literal meaning. "Variable" means that the number of parameters is variable and uncertain. When defining a function in Python, add a "*" or "**" modifier to the parameter, then the parameter is a deformable parameter. 

![avatar]( aa24ffc6cb8403250fb2b57e024c7730.png) 

##  14.3.2 operators * and ** 

(1) Use * to collect arguments as tuples 

When defining a function in Python, a "*" operator is preceded by a parameter, so when executing a function call, the Python interpreter will collect all the arguments starting at the position of the parameter into a tuple. 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574591602
 ```  
>  The order of collection of deformable parameters is to start from the position of the deformable parameters and collect them from left to right 

Since deformable parameters are collected from left to right, we usually place deformable parameters to the right of ordinary parameters when defining functions. If deformable parameters are placed to the left of ordinary parameters, then in order for ordinary parameters to work, function calls must be made in the form of keyword parameters. 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574591602
 ```  
(2) Use ** to collect arguments into a dictionary 

When defining a function, use the ** operator to decorate the parameter, and pass the parameter as a keyword parameter when calling the function, then Python will collect the argument at the beginning of the parameter position as a dictionary type. 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574591602
 ```  
(3) Mixing "*" with "**" 

Use a mix of * and ** operators to decorate parameters. 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574591602
 ```  
(4) *args 追**kwargs 

* Args and ** kwargs are common ways to write deformable parameter names. The former is used to package arguments into a tuple type, and the latter is used to package arguments into a dictionary type. Students can follow this general way of writing when actually defining functions, or they can define variable parameter names by themselves. 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574591602
 ```  
##  14.3.3 unpacking arguments 

When defining a function, using * or ** collects arguments into a tuple or dictionary. When using * or ** to decorate a function, it unpacks arguments. The so-called unpacking is to take the elements in the data set and assign them to the corresponding parameters. To understand this usage, let's take a look at a code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574591602
 ```  
In the above code, the accumulate function has two parameters, number1 and number2. There are two elements in the actual parameter numbers. After unpacking numbers, the parameter corresponding to element value 1 is number1, and the parameter corresponding to element value 2 is number2. Then, calling accumulate (* numbers) is equivalent to calling accumulate (1,2). 

(1) Use * to unpack the iterable object 

Iterable objects learned so far are: string type, list, tuple, dictionary, collection. When unpacking dictionaries, collections, etc., the elements unpacked are the corresponding key names. In actual development, the ** operator is usually used to unpack dictionaries. 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574591602
 ```  
(2) Use ** to unpack the dictionary 

When unpacking the dictionary, the key name in the dictionary corresponds to the parameter name in the function one-to-one, and the argument is the key value corresponding to the key name. 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574591602
 ```  
The key names in the dictionary must correspond one-to-one with the parameter names in the function, otherwise Python will throw an exception message with the wrong type. 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574591602
 ```  
When the above code is executed, the program throws an exception message with a wrong type because the dictionary key name median cannot find the corresponding parameter name in the accumulate function. 

##  14.3.4 knowledge points 

>  (1) When defining a function, use the * and ** operators to define variable parameters, and when calling a function, use the * and ** operators to unpack the parameters.

When using the * operator to define a variable parameter, Python collects arguments starting at the parameter position into a tuple.

(3) When using the ** operator to define a variable parameter, Python collects the arguments starting at the parameter position into a dictionary.

##  14.5.1 understand function decorators 

Before getting to the main topic, let's take a look at the explanation of the words "decoration". The following content is quoted from Baidu Encyclopedia: 

>  Decoration, "Ci Yuan" explained as "the person who decorates, the person who hides, the person who decorates, the thing is done and the literary style is also." Refers to adding patterns and colors to the surface of utensils to achieve the purpose of beautification. 

"Decoration" itself contains the meaning of functional expansion, such as coloring objects, which is the expansion of color, and adding decorations to objects, which is the expansion of decorations. Our usual reading, fitness, and learning are also an expansion, through many ways to improve our inner and outer. 

![avatar]( 53ef863f730c0a841ea8813b3ab3432a.png) 

Using this analogy, it is easy to understand that decorators in programming languages are also used for functional extensions. In object oriented, decorators are a software design pattern that can extend existing objects functionally without changing their structure. 

>  In the course of Chapter 16, object oriented programming will be explained in detail. 

So, how can we use decorators to extend functionality? We need to learn about closure functions in Python first. 

##  14.5.2 understand closure functions 

A closure function, simply understood, is an inner function defined in a function that can access parameters and variables in the scope of the outer function. 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574526079
 ```  
Code explanation: 

>  In the above code, a login function is defined, and a check function is defined inside the login function to check the user's login status. The login function is an external function of the check function, and inside the check function, the _USER_INFO variable in the login function is accessed. Functions like check are closures. 

##  14.5.3 extend functionality with closures 

Suppose we define a welcome page in web development, and you don't need to log in to enter the welcome page at first. Define a welcome function to simulate the output of the welcome page: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574526079
 ```  
As the project continues to iterate, the user is now required to log in before the welcome page pops up. How to extend the welcome function at this time? There are two expansion schemes: 

>  (1) directly modify the welcome function and check the user's login status within the welcome function

(2) Make the closure function share the same parameters as the welcome function, so that the user's login status can be checked in the closure function, and then the welcome function can be executed if the user is logged in. 

Adopting the first scheme will change the code logic of the welcome function. Adopting the second scheme is to transfer the extension logic of the code to the closure function. Now, the reader is invited to review the definition of the decorator pattern: to extend the functionality of an existing object without changing its structure. The second scheme adopted is the so-called decorator pattern. In Python's decorator pattern, its core is to use the closure function to extend the functionality of the decorated object. 

Now, through the second scheme, to check the user's login status, functions in Python can accept any type of parameter, and we can directly pass the welcome function as a parameter to the login function. 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574526079
 ```  
##  14.5.4 more elegant approach: decorator syntactic sugar 

In 14.5.3 section, we extend the functionality of other functions through closure functions, but it is not intuitive and natural to use: 

>  (1) You need to pass the decorated function as an argument to the decorator

(2) The returned closure function needs to be executed again 

Python provides syntactic sugar, adding a line of @decortator modifier in front of the function header to decorate the current function, decortator represents the specific decorator name. In the above code, the login function is a decorator, and now use the @symbol to decorate the welcome function. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574526079
 ```  
After decorating the welcome function with @login, Python will automatically pass the wecome function as an argument to the login function and execute the returned closure function, which is the core logic of the Python decorator. The closure function parameters in the decorator must be the same as the parameters of the decorated object. When you are not sure about the parameters of the decorated object, you can use variable parameters: * args, ** kwargs. Decorator structures with variable parameters: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574526079
 ```  
When using decorator syntax sugar, decorators can also carry parameters, usually by nesting another layer of closure functions, defining the decorator's parameters in the outermost function of the decorator, and passing the decorated object in the second layer: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574526079
 ```  
Now continue to extend the welcome function to jump to the login page when the user is not logged in. 

Code example: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574526079
 ```  
In Python, decorators defined using function objects are called function decorators. Decorators defined using class types are called class decorators. This article focuses on function decorators, and the same principle applies to class decorators. 

>  In later lessons, the French Fries teacher will explain class decorators in Python in detail. 

The core of decorator is to extend the functions of existing objects without changing their structure. In actual development, we can extend the functions of cache, log output and so on for executable objects through decorator. 

##  14.5.5 knowledge points 

>  (1) Decorators are also used for functional extensions. In Object Oriented, a decorator is a software design pattern that extends an existing object functionally without changing its structure.

(2) A closure function, simply understood, is an inner function defined in a function that can access parameters and variables in the scope of the outer function.

4.1.1 what the command line is 

4.1.2 enter the Windows command line 

4.1.3 common commands in Windows 

4.1.4 Windows environment variables PATH 

4.1.5 system to learn Python 

##  4.1.1 What is the command line? 

The command line, also known as the command prompt, is a tool provided by the operating system that can directly execute commands. In the command line interface, you can see a blinking underscore input prompt, "prompting" you to enter commands. The command line interface in Windows: 

![avatar]( 4f9f1044bc18ff034df0191701f747ec.png) 

##  4.1.2 enter the windows command line 

The cmd command is a command-line program in the windows system. In the windows10 system, press the windows key on the keyboard, and then directly enter cmd. The system will automatically match the command prompt tool: 

![avatar]( 09e12c28d51252cc4dcb8989003a3c48.png) 

Pressing the enter key will bring up the Windows command-line window: 

![avatar]( 9433d0b9ad7832d99d8aa6267b44ab79.png) 

In the command line window, you can execute commands from the system. 

##  4.1.3 common commands in Windows 

(1) cd: switch directory 

CD means "change directory" in English, which translates to switch directory. 

In Windows, directories are separated by the "\" symbol, such as the B directory in the A directory, which can be expressed as A\ B.

The. symbol and the.. symbol are special directory symbols in the system. The. symbol represents the current directory and the. symbol represents the parent directory.

The Windows system has the concept of a drive letter, which is the identifier of the disk device. For example, the drive letter of the C disk is C:, and the drive letter of the D disk is D:.

Enter the drive letter on the command line to switch directly to another disk.

In windows, directory switching can only be performed within the drive letter, and it cannot be directly switched to directories in other drive letters.

To switch to a directory with another drive letter, you need to switch between drive letters first. 

The basic syntax of the cd command: 

cd directory 

The directory parameter represents the directory name to be switched. 

Example demonstration: 

Switch from the C drive to the python3-learning directory of the D drive on the command line: 

![avatar]( 0073061c7c1c05f88999de98fee963ac.png) 

In the picture above, first enter the drive letter d: to switch to the D drive, and then execute the "cd python3-learning" command to switch to the python3-learning directory. Switch to the parent directory of the python3-learning directory: 

![avatar]( ea8be0d1b0951ed2ce4e528170539f5a.png) 

The.. symbol indicates the parent directory, and directly cd.. can be switched to the parent directory of the current directory. 

When switching directories or executing other commands, there is no need to type out the full path name, press the TAB key of the keyboard, and the system will automatically complete it.

For example, when switching to the python3-learning directory on the D disk, just enter cd python3 and press the TAB key, and the system will automatically complete it as

cd python3-learning。 

(2) dir: view directory 

Execute the dir command to view the files and subdirectories in the directory. The basic syntax of the dir command: 

dir directory 

Directory represents the directory name in the system. When the parameter directory is empty, it indicates that the files and subdirectories in the current directory are viewed. 

Example demonstration: 

Check the files in the python3-learning directory: 

![avatar]( 9eafa5355148b7177ab341b078ab12bb.png) 

In the output of the dir command, the directory files with the < DIR > flag are represented, and the others are normal files. Text files, pictures, audio & video files, etc. are all normal files. View the files in the .idea directory: 

dir .idea 

![avatar]( ba02e599dc143ce29a16aa83ac80fc9f.png) 

(3) type: view file 

Execute the type command to view the contents of the file. The basic syntax of the type command: 

type path_of_file 

path_of_file represents the path to the file and can view the contents of the file across disks. 

Example demonstration: 

Check the hellopython.py in the python3-learning directory of the D disk in the C disk: 

type D:\python3-learning\hellopython.py 

![avatar]( 15dfbb26504fcce1a7a220d5117b6718.png) 

(4) more: view the file 

Executing the more command can also view the contents of the file. The basic syntax of the more command: 

more path_of_file 

path_of_file represents the path of the file, you can view the contents of the file across the disk, compared with the type command, more supports segmented display of the file, when the file is relatively large, it is recommended to use the more command to view. The main options of the more command: 

![avatar]( 45c33496066e6df79d3ae2a28cafe49b.jpeg) 

Example demonstration: 

Check the workspace.xml file in the idea subdirectory under the python3-learning directory of the D disk in the C disk: 

more D:\python3-learning\.idea\workspace.xml 

![avatar]( 4cea17e553c963f72cc6e9038b86568b.png) 

From the output, you can see a prompt for the proportion of content output: 

More (24%) 

It indicates that 24% of the content of the file has been displayed, and pressing the p key of the keyboard will prompt you to enter a number of lines: 

![avatar]( 4067807df2c540cc0ee06e2db809a98e.png) 

Enter the specified number of lines, and the more command will display the next n lines. To exit the display of the More command, press the q key directly on the keyboard. 

(5) mkdir: create directory 

The mkdir command is used to create directories. The basic syntax of the command is: 

mkdir path_of_directory 

Parameter path_of_directory represents the path of the directory, mkdir can collapse the disk to create a directory. 

Create the docs subdirectory under the python3-learning directory of the D disk in the C disk: 

mkdir D:\python3-learning\docs 

![avatar]( 918c9c602a6a02bb886f3ab117937722.png) 

Use the dir command to see if the creation was successful. 

![avatar]( b759473c7a56e4f42b2e373b005a6a35.png) 

From the output of the dir command, it can be seen that the docs directory has been successfully created. The opposite of mkdir is the rd command, which is used to force the deletion of the directory and all files and subdirectories under the directory. When using the rd command to force deletion, you need to add the/s and/q options:, 

![avatar]( 1ac5cf814ca925618c6a2e57bd710f3c.png) 

After executing the rd command to force deletion, the output of the dir command shows that the docs directory has been deleted. 

(6) echo: content output 

Executing the echo command directly will echo the content to the command line: 

![avatar]( 074f8878aa66ed7b8c3edb50b0697553.png) 

With the redirect symbol >, you can write content to a file, and if the file doesn't exist, a new file is created. 

![avatar]( c20f3151cba4e1ba907b74a5bde516db.png) 

The command in the image above is: 

echo > d:\python3-learning\test.py 

It means to write the empty content to the test.py file in the python3-learning directory of the D disk. Since the test.py file does not exist, a new test.py will be created. When executing the dir command to view, you will find that there is an extra test.py file in the python3-learning directory: 

![avatar]( eeb7f915cddee51098290300d9d3c759.png) 

(7) cls: clear screen operation 

Executing the cls command on the command line clears the screen. 

(8) exit: exit the command line 

Executing the exit command on the command line exits the current command line. 

##  4.1.4 Windows environment variables PATH 

(1) Introduction to PATH 

Environment variables are a series of parameters of the operating environment of the system, such as system environment variables PATH. PATH saves parameters related to the path. The system searches for the path saved by PATH in the path search. 

In the command line, you can directly execute the system's built-in commands. If you need to execute third-party installed programs in the command line,

Then the executable program must be added to the environment variables PATH. 

When installing Python in Chapter 1, you can see the options added by PATH on the installation interface: 

![avatar]( 0c675d1e564351339d453423ea349323.png) 

When this option is checked, the system will automatically add the installed Python interpreter to the system environment variables PATH. 

(2) Manually configure PATH 

Add the windows command line and execute the sysdm.cpl command, which will pop up a system property setting window: 

![avatar]( b519eb40f72a7a0ed60d9df1fda0d88a.png) 

Click on the advanced options in the window to see a button for environment variables: 

![avatar]( 361b0bc6933f026400f071100ef7e5f3.png) 

Clicking the environment variables button will bring up the environment variables settings window: 

![avatar]( 194b5a2d3b620de03e5017e8cec3e189.png) 

Among them, the user variable is only valid for the current user, and the system variable is valid for all users in the system. Readers can decide whether to configure user variables or system variables according to the actual situation. When configuring the Path variable, double-click the Path variable with the mouse, and the configuration window of the Path variable will pop up: 

![avatar]( 7515e43d7162f9610768147684e75b10.png) 

Click the New button to add the absolute path of the third-party executable program to the Path variable, and then click OK to complete the configuration process of the Path variable. The same principle applies to the configuration of other environment variables.

##  4.2.1 build Linux virtual machine 

When developing in the enterprise, the Linux system is usually used as the server, and it is necessary for readers to master the basic knowledge of the Linux system first. To operate in the Linux, it is mainly through the command line in the end point. Before that, readers need to set up Linux learning environment. 

In this section, the author teaches students how to create Linux virtual machine in Windows system. 

Follow these steps to create Linux virtual machine: 

(1) Install VMware Workstation Player 

Download the latest version of VMWare Workstation Player from VMware's official website: 

下载 VMware Workstation Player | VMware | CN 

After downloading to the local area and installing it successfully, click the icon of VMware Workstation Player on the desktop, and the following window will appear:

Then execute the shutdown -r now command to restart. 

##  Common commands in 4.2.3 Linux 

(1) Directory display: ls 

The ls command is used to display the contents of the directory. The basic syntax of the ls command is: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574589604
 ```  
path_of_directory represents the path of the directory, and when the path is empty, the contents of the current directory will be displayed by default. 

Example demonstration: 

Display all files in the current directory: 

![avatar]( ad44f32be78a713ded9ab7cb529773ad.png) 

(2) View Help: man 

Linux the commands in the system provide a wealth of options. To view the definition of the command and the usage of the options, you can use the man command in the system. 

Basic usage of the man command: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574589604
 ```  
Command represents the name of the command. 

Example demonstration: 

Review the ls command's definition and option usage: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574589604
 ```  
![avatar]( 0b93bd4db735e3ed0f93c337891cc590.png) 

Press the q key on the keyboard to exit the man command. 

In the output of the man ls command, you can see the description of the ls command: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574589604
 ```  
From the description of the ls command, ls is used to display the contents of the directory. 

Linux the options in the command are mainly divided into short options and long options, with a dash symbol "-" for the short option,

Long options are those with two dashes. When command options take arguments, the arguments must follow the options. 

For example, -a in the ls command is the short option, --all is the long option. Multiple options in the command can be used together. Continuing to use the ls command as an example, it can be seen from the output of man that the --all option will display all files including the. and.. symbols (prefixed with.), and the -l option will display the author of the file. 

Example demonstration: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574589604
 ```  
![avatar]( dc680d89ec7d563edd187cc57110ce2d.png) 

(3) Directory switch: cd 

The cd command in Linux is similar to the cd command in windows, and is used to switch directories. In Linux systems, there are also two special directory symbols. and.., which represent the current directory and the parent directory respectively. Readers should note that in Linux systems, the separator between directories is "/". 

Linux system does not have the concept of disk letters, in Linux system everything is a file, directory is also a file, all files with "/" as the root directory. 

Basic usage of the cd command: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574589604
 ```  
Parameter path_of_directory represents the path of the directory, when the directory is empty, it will automatically switch to the current user's home directory. 

The path to the home directory is: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574589604
 ```  
Username represents the login username. For example, if the author's login username is chipscoco, then the home directory is: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574589604
 ```  
Example demonstration: 

Switch to home directory: 

![avatar]( 8b77f85ae6b4b541c0bf1675202255d8.png) 

Switch to the home directory as a directory path: 

cd /home/chipscoco 

![avatar]( 01bc30e9423ef2fa9d8faa8767ecda8a.png) 

Linux command line also provides the function of automatic completion, when performing operations such as directory switching, pressing the TAB key of the keyboard can automatically complete the command. 

(4) Directory creation: mkdir 

The mkdir command is used to create directories. Basic usage of mkdir: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574589604
 ```  
Example demonstration: 

Create the python3-learning directory in the home directory: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574589604
 ```  
![avatar]( 09dd6571c1b2d703f3d7b1b05e757848.png) 

Directory creation is the opposite of directory deletion, using the rm command to delete files, and adding the -rf option to force deletion when the directory is not empty. 

Before deleting files, it is a good habit to maintain a file backup. 

(5) File copy: cp 

The cp command is used for copying files. The basic usage of the cp command is: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574589604
 ```  
The parameter source represents the original file or directory, and dest represents the new file or directory after copying. When the directory is not empty, the -r option needs to be added. 

Example demonstration: 

![avatar]( 872c7129da3fb8a2dae9cf6be6dd09dd.png) 

In the figure, the docs directory was created in python3-learning through the mkdir python-learning/docs command respectively. Then copy the python-learning directory to the new directory python3 through the cp -r command. 

(6) File editing: vim 

Vim in the Linux system is an editor, and in the eyes of technical geeks, vim is called "the artifact in the editor". The detailed usage of the vim tool is not introduced in this book, and interested readers can learn from other materials. 

Basic usage of the vim command: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574589604
 ```  
path_of_file represents the path to the file, and a new file is created when the file does not exist. 

There are three modes in the VIM editor: 

![avatar]( 62b455335fc8fefa7fe9c9749689c5ad.jpeg) 

Example demonstration: 

Switch to the python3-learning directory and edit hellopython.py file: 

![avatar]( 42c5b91d587c7b79892f235bc1aea022.png) 

When entering the editor, you initially enter command mode. 

![avatar]( 66a9c96784f8325f03f5b6e76813e919.png)

![avatar]( b69cddb91e5b4920e35468021f9e1ed2.png) 

Edit the file in vim: 

![avatar]( f2ad77e832afc60ab0effead5d46e743.png) 

Switch to command mode, then switch to last line mode. Enter x in last line mode to exit vim: 

![avatar]( 4ce72afd596fabecdecd1c118db685d6.png) 

(7) View files: head, tail, cat, more 

Linux the head, tail, cat, more commands can be used to view the content of the file, the content display is slightly different, head is used to display 10 lines of content starting from the file header, tail is used to display 10 lines of content starting from the end of the file, cat is used to connect multiple files and output to the screen. The more command is similar to the more command of the windows system, which is used to display the content in sections. 

Example demonstration: 

View file contents in hellopython.py: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574589604

In this section, the basic usage of common commands in the Linux system is introduced. Learning the above commands is basically enough for beginners to cope with daily development work. 

For the detailed usage of the command, the reader can find it through the man command. For further study of the Linux system,

I recommend the book Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting. 

##  4.2.4 Linux environment variables PATH 

(1) Introduction to PATH 

Linux environment variables of the system and environment variables of the windows system, save a series of parameters of the system running environment, such as environment variables PATH, save the parameters related to the path. 

(2) Configure PATH 

Format of PATH:

The concept of 6.1.1 variables 

Naming 6.1.2 variables 

Definition of 6.1.3 variables 

6.1.4 variable stores the address 

6.1.5 system to learn Python 

##  The concept of 6.1.1 variables 

After entering the fantasy forest of the programming world, the first obstacle that beginners will encounter is variables. Defining variables in Python is simple. A variable name, an equal sign, and a value can define a variable: 

Variable name = value 

But understanding the variables clearly requires some effort. 

So, what exactly are variables? 

Beginners can understand a variable as a container, such as the bottles and jars seen in ordinary life. The main purpose of these bottles and jars is to hold items. Since a variable is a container, it also has the characteristics of a container. In computer programs, variables are used to store data. Secondly, variables are constantly changing, but what changes is the data inside the container. For example, bottles and jars used to hold items, bottles and jars do not change, only the items in the bottle change. In a program, assigning variables to other variables is like transferring items from bottles to other bottles. 

![avatar]( e8aa9d494760d8ad3584b64d0bb69cb0.png) 

>  All the items in the bottle are dumped into other bottles, and the original bottle becomes an empty bottle. But in a computer program, just copying the value pointed to by the variable does not empty the value pointed to by the variable. 

##  Naming 6.1.2 variables 

(1) Naming rules 

People have names, and so do variables. Variables cannot be referenced in a program if they do not have names. For example, two unnamed variables are defined at the same time. How to refer to anonymous variables in code is a problem. People's names have their customary naming rules, usually named by surnames and first names. Variables in programming languages also have their own set of naming rules. Naming rules for variables in Python language: 

>  Variable names are usually 26 English letters (both upper and lower case), numbers and underscores _ combined, the first character of the variable name cannot be a number, variable names cannot use system predefined keywords 

>  Keywords in Python are reserved for Python use, so they can no longer be named using keywords. We will explain more later when we introduce the interactive mode. Execute help ("keywords") in the interactive mode to view all the keywords predefined by the system. In Python 3, you can use UTF-8 characters such as Chinese characters to name variables. 

Variable names must comply with the naming conventions in the programming language, otherwise they cannot run. A legal variable name does not mean a good variable name. A good variable name, usually named with English words, should not be too long, must have a certain meaning, and be readable. Not paying attention to the naming of variables, or even naming them at will, is a common problem for beginners. 

(2) Naming example 

Legal variable names: 

name, title, content 

Illegal variable name: 

1name,?title,content* 

In these three illegal variable names, the first variable name has a number at the beginning, the second variable name has an illegal character at the beginning, and the third variable name contains illegal characters. In addition, there is an important detail here, variable names are case-sensitive in Python, which means that Name and name represent different variables. 

(3) Naming style 

In postmodernism, which pursues diversity, "individual freedom," "self-contained system," and "critical right" have become a series of unique labels for followers. But in team development, the pursuit of diversity often leads to confusion. Using a unified naming style can improve the overall readability of the project code. The stronger the readability, the easier the project is to maintain. Three commonly used variable naming styles: 

Hump nomenclature, mixed nomenclature, underscore nomenclature 

In hump nomenclature, the first letter of a word is capitalized. 

Example of big hump nomenclature: 

PriceOfLove 

In the small hump nomenclature, the first word of a variable is all lowercase, and the first letter of all other words is uppercase. 

Examples of small hump nomenclature: 

priceOfLove 

The so-called underscore nomenclature is the underscore that connects words, and words are generally lowercase. 

Example of underscore nomenclature: 

price_of_love 

In Python, variable names are usually in lowercase, and the big hump naming convention is used to name class types. For more naming conventions, interested readers can refer to the famous PEP8 specification. 

##  Definition of 6.1.3 variables 

To use a variable in a program, you need to define the variable first, otherwise an error exception of "variable undefined" will be thrown during the execution of the program. Defining variables in Python is simple, use the = sign to define variables, for example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574522122
 ```  
In the variable definition above, the variable name is total and the value is 66. When defining a variable, you can use a defined variable to assign values to other variables, such as: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574522122
 ```  
In the variable definition above, Python will first take the value stored by the variable total, and then assign the value to the amount. The "value" here is the memory address in CPython. CPython is a Python interpreter. The Python we use, unless otherwise specified, usually refers to CPython. 

##  6.1.4 variable stores the address 

(1) Understanding the memory address 

The so-called address of memory is essentially a number. In a computer, memory can be regarded as a large array of bytes, which are numbered in sequence starting from 0. The following diagram shows the logical structure of memory in a computer: 

![avatar]( 2b3c9f843825b3d32fe31d2dd7e7c888.jpeg) 

The number in the figure is the memory address. Each cell represents a block of memory with a size of one byte. Assuming that the memory number where the value 66 is located is 2, then this 2 is the memory address of 66. 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574522122
 ```  
The variable total essentially holds the memory address of the value 66:2. When assigning the variable total to the variable amount, Python mainly does the following two steps: 

One: remove the memory address of 66 from the variable total 2

Two: Assign memory address 2 of 66 to the variable amount 

The final variables total and amount both hold the same memory address, that is, they refer to the same piece of memory data. 

![avatar]( c47159ea3228ec6dacea836fca03de24.png) 

(2) Check the memory address 

In Python, you can output the memory address of a variable or value through the built-in function id. Just pass the variable or value as an argument to the id function. For example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574522122
 ```  
Interactive mode in Python is introduced in Section 6.5, which shows how to view the memory address of a variable or value through the id function.

##   6.4.1 IndentationError 

When beginners learn Python, an IndentationError will be raised if they are not careful. For example, the following code: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574589966
 ```  
Now ask students to write the above example code into a Python script file, and then run the script on the command line or in the IDE. 

>  Students can review the content in Chapter 2 to learn how to run Python programs in the IDE. Review the content in Section 5.1 to learn how to execute Python programs on the command line. 

After running the script, the following error message appears on the command line or in the output window of the IDE: 

 File "demo.py", line 9

    Print ("Happy")

    ^

IndentationError: unexpected indent 

From the error message, an IndentationError appears on line 9 of the file. Open the source code file with PyCharm, and the IDE will mark a red wavy line at the beginning of the code that raises the exception:

IndentationError is called a code indentation error in Python. If you write a program without following Python's code indentation rules, an IndentationError will be thrown during the execution of the program. 

>  IndentationError is a built-in exception type in Python that represents indentation errors. When students are beginners to Python, they will throw various exceptions without paying attention, such as common syntax errors, indentation errors, coding errors, etc. 

Exception is a built-in error handling mechanism in Python. When Python interprets and executes a program script, it will throw an exception once an error occurs. When an exception occurs, students should be good at analyzing the error message and find the key to solving the problem from the error message. 

##  6.4.2 What is code indentation 

Code indentation in programming languages refers to adjusting the distance between the code and the parent edge, which is measured by the number of spaces. For example, indenting four spaces means four spaces away from the parent edge. For example, the following code contains indentation:

 ```  
##  6.4.3 code indentation rules 

Python takes a mandatory indentation of code. Students must write code according to its indentation rules when writing Python programs, otherwise the program will report an error and throw an IndentationError error exception when running. The following is the summary of the French fries teacher, the code indentation rules in Python: 

>  (1) Global code does not require indentation, it must be top-level

(2) Statements at the same level must contain the same number of indented spaces

(3) child-level statements and parent-level statements must be indented

(4) Single-line comments can be indented at will, and multi-line comments maintain the same indentation as code at the same level 

Now let's explain the code indentation rules in Python through an example: 

Python

 ```  
Students should note that although single-line comments can be indented at will, in actual development, they are usually indented at the same level as multi-line comments. 

>  The Tab key in the keyboard outputs whitespace characters. Its encoding in the computer system is different from the encoding of spaces. In some IDEs or editors, they automatically convert the output of the Tab key to 4 or 8 spaces. Students may need to make additional configuration when using the integrated development environment, otherwise it will bring problems on porting. The best practice is to use only the space bar to output spaces where code indentation is required, so there will be no errors. 

##  6.4.4 meaning of code indentation 

Code indentation allows you to distinguish the logical hierarchy of source code, such as the following code: 

Python 

 ```python

 ```  
From the writing form of the source code, it can be immediately seen that the child code block below the colon. Code indentation can standardize the writing format of the code, making the source code look neater and more beautiful as a whole.

7.1.4 conditional controls can be nested 

7.1.5 if statement ternary operation 

Learn Python 7.1.6 System 

##  7.1.1 understand conditional control 

In daily life, we often like to say if, "what if, then what will happen". "What if" expresses a hypothetical situation, that is, if the hypothesis is true, a certain operation will be performed, and if the hypothesis is not true, the same operation will be performed. 

For example, in the following "if" sentence: 

>  If it is sunny tomorrow, I will go to climb Lotus Mountain. Otherwise, I will go to the coffee shop downstairs and have a cup of coffee. 

The assumptions made in the above sentence are: 

>  It will be sunny tomorrow. 

The operation performed when the assumption is true: 

>  Climb Lotus Mountain 

The action performed when the assumption is not true: 

>  Drink coffee 

This kind of logical structure expressed in "if" sentences is a kind of conditional control. The core of conditional control is to first propose a hypothetical condition, if the condition is true, what kind of operation is performed, and if the condition is not true, continue to judge other conditions. In programming languages, conditional control is also carried out through "if", which corresponds to the keyword "if", and the Chinese definition of if is "if". 

##  7.1.2 if,elif,else 

In Python, if, elif, and else are used for conditional control. 

>  Students can find the definition and usage of the if, elif, and else keywords in the interactive mode. Take if as an example: help ("if"). 

Syntax structure of conditional control: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574586447
 ```  
If means if. Expression is a conditional expression in the conditional control structure. Usually, anything that can output a value can be used as a conditional expression. If the value of the conditional expression is true value, then the corresponding operation. elif is used to represent a branch condition, that is, if the condition in the if statement is not satisfied, continue to determine whether the condition in the elif statement is satisfied. Else represents an operation performed when the conditions in the if statement and the elif statement are not satisfied. 

>  The colon in the syntax structure indicates the beginning of a conditional block. In the syntax structure of conditional control, elif and else are not necessary. There can be multiple elif, but only one else at most. 

Illegal conditional control structure: 

Python

 ```  
In the above illegal conditional control structure, there are multiple else statements. The elif statement must follow the if statement, and the else statement must be the last statement in the control structure.

 ```  
In the above illegal conditional control structure, the elif statement must follow the if statement, and the else statement must be the last statement in the control structure. When there are multiple if statements, Python treats each if statement as a separate conditional control structure:

 ```  
##  7.1.3 conditional expression 

If the value of the conditional expression is true, then the corresponding operation is performed. 

Code example (1): 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574586447
 ```  
In the above code example, a is_happy variable is defined, which points to a value of 0, and the logical value converted from 0 is false. So the code in the if statement will not be executed, but the code below the else statement will be executed, and the output is: 

i am so unhappy 

Code example (2): 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574586447
 ```  
In the above code example, an x variable is defined, which points to the value 1, and a y variable is defined, which points to the value -1. The value of x + y is 0, so the expression x + y > 0 is equivalent to 0 > 0. Obviously, the value of the expression is false, so we will continue to determine whether the condition in the elif statement is true. The conditional expression in elif is "x + y == 0", and the value of the expression is true, so the code in the elif statement will be executed: 

Python 

 ```python

 ```  
The output of the final program is: 

x+y == 0 

Code example (3): 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574586447
 ```  
In the above code example, an x variable is defined, which points to the value -1, and a y variable is defined, which points to the value -1. The value of x * y is 1, so the value of the expression x * y > 0 is true. The value of x + y is -2, so the value of the expression x + y > 0 is false. The conditional expression in the if statement is "x + y > 0 and x * y > 0", which is equivalent to "true and false". In the logical AND operation, as long as one of the logical values is false, then the output is false. Therefore, the next conditional branch will be judged: 

elif x+y > 0 

The value of the expression x + y = 0 is false, and Python will proceed to determine the next conditional branch: "elif x * y > 0". The value of the expression x * y > 0 is true, so the code below the colon is executed: 

Print ("Both x and y are negative") 

The output of the final program is: 

Both x and y are negative 

Students need to clarify the judgment logic in the code when analyzing the execution process of the above code. Why are both x and y negative? 

##  7.1.4 conditional controls can be nested 

Nesting means that conditional statements can be nested under conditional statements. Readers should pay attention to the code indentation when the if statement is nested. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574586447
 ```  
The program output is: 

i'm so happy to learn Python!

Both x and y are negative 

If the depth of the nesting should not be too deep, it is usually kept within three layers. Too many nesting layers will lead to poor readability of the code and difficult to maintain. 

##  7.1.5 if statement ternary operation 

Ternary operators are a fixed format in software programming. In Python, ternary operators are implemented through if statements. 

Syntax format of ternary operators: 

expression1 if condition_expression else expression2 

The execution logic of the ternary operator is: if the value of the conditional expression condition_expression in the if statement is true, return the value of the expression expression1, otherwise return the value of the expression expression2. 

Using ternary operators can simplify the use of if statements in specific scenarios. 

Code examples that do not use ternary operators: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574586447
 ```  
Code example using the ternary operator: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574586447
 ```  
These two code examples achieve the same effect, but the code using the ternary operator looks more concise. In the case of more conditional branches, it is not suitable to use the ternary operator. Readers need to use it reasonably according to the actual situation.

7.2.1 understand circular control

7.2.3 while loop structure 

7.2.4 loop structure can be nested 

7.2.5 knowledge points 

Learn Python 7.2.6 System 

##  7.2.1 understand circular control 

To understand loop control, you must first understand what a loop is. The following is quoted from a Chinese dictionary: 

Cycle means to go back and forth, when something moves or changes over and over again, or does something repeatedly and continuously

![avatar]( fb4fea5bb903d9c813b2f4bceca284d1.png) 

Then, by analogy in a programming language, it is easy to understand loop control: controlling the repeated execution of a program through certain instructions. By controlling the repeated execution of program instructions, programmers can be freed from the tedious work of writing code. Students first consider the following question: 

Calculate the sum of all natural numbers between 1 and 10

At first glance, it seems like a very simple problem. To solve this problem, simply list all the natural numbers between 1 and 10, and then add them directly. 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574594121
 ```  
But if the problem is changed to "calculate the sum of all natural numbers between 1 and 100,000", how to write the program code? It is very inefficient to add numbers by hand. For such problems, the loop control in the programming language can provide the perfect solution. 

##  7.2.2 for loop structure 

In Python, the loop structure is defined by the for and while keywords, and the else statement in the loop structure is used to define the operation to be performed when the loop exits normally. 

>  Students can find the definition and usage of keywords such as for and while in the interactive mode, and develop a good habit of searching in the interactive mode. For example, find the definition and usage of the for keyword: help ("for"). 

(1) for loop basic grammar 

The grammatical structure of a for loop: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574594121
 ```  
target_list represents a list of target values, expression_list represents a list of expressions, and the else statement in the loop is used to define the operation performed when the loop exits normally. In the for loop structure, the values in the expression list are traversed one by one, and then the values are assigned to the parameter target_list. In Python, expression lists can be defined directly through English commas, such as: 

1,2,3,4,5 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574594121
 ```  
The program output is: 

1

2

3

4

5 

Code Explanation: 

The for loop iterates through the values in the expression list one by one, and then assigns the traversed values to the variable number. The value in the expression list is (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), and there are 5 values in the set, so the for loop iterates over 5 times, each time assigning the traversed value to the variable number. For example, the first traversed value is 1, and then assigned to the variable number, the second traversed value is 2, and the same is assigned to the variable number, and so on. 

Comma-separated expressions are actually tuple types in Python, which will be explained in detail later when introducing data types. 

(2) The else statement in the for loop 

The else statement in the loop is not necessary. If you want to define the operation to be performed when the loop exits normally, you need to add an else statement to the for loop structure. The else in the for loop structure is usually used to define the closing operation after the loop exits normally. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574594121
 ```  
The program output is: 

1

2

3

4

5

The for loop exits normally 

(3) Execute the break exit loop 

The so-called abnormal exit of the loop refers to the execution of the break command in the loop. When Python is interpreting the execution of the script, if it finds that the current instruction is break, it will immediately exit the current loop. 

>  The break command can only be used in a loop structure. If used elsewhere, Python will throw an exception message with a syntax error. 

Code example:

 ```  
The program output is: 

1

2

3

4 

(3) range type 

Python provides a range type that can be used to generate integer sequences. Basic usage of the range type: 

range(start, stop[, step]) 

The parameters start and stop are used to construct a left-closed and right-open interval [start, stop) of the integer sequence. Assuming the value of start is 0 and the value of stop is 5, then the left-closed and right-open interval is [0, 5). The integer sequence corresponding to the range (0, 5) is: 

0,1,2,3,4 

Step is an optional parameter. The so-called optional parameter can be filled in or not. The step parameter is used to represent the step size between adjacent numbers. Continuing to take the left-closed and right-open interval [0, 5) as an example, assuming the step size is 2, the integer sequence corresponding to range (0, 5, 2) is: 

0,2,4

The starting number is 0, so the next number is 0 + 2, which is 2.

The next number in #2 is 2 + 2, which is 4. Students can do the same. 

When passing only one parameter to the range type, a forward interval is constructed from 0 to that parameter. For example, when passing the parameter value 5, the forward interval is constructed as [0, 5). When the passed parameter value is less than or equal to 0, no integer is generated. When the step size passed to the range type is negative, a descending sorted sequence of integers can be generated. At this time, the value of start must be greater than the value of stop.

 ```  
The program output is: 

5

4

3

2

1 

Using the integer sequence generated by the range type, and then through the loop structure, the sum of all natural numbers between 1 and 10000 can be calculated. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574594121
 ```  
The program output is: 

50005000 

50005000 is the sum of all natural numbers between 1 and 10000. 

##  7.2.3 while loop structure 

(1) While loop basic syntax 

The grammatical structure of the while loop: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574594121
 ```  
Expression represents an expression. When the value of the expression is true value, the code below the while will be executed in a loop. The else in the while is the same as the else in the for loop, which is used to define the operation to be performed when the loop exits normally. You can also execute break in the while loop to exit the loop. 

View the definition and usage of the while keyword in interactive mode: help ("while") 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574594121
 ```  
The expression in while is 0, and the value of 0 is false, so the print function in the while loop will not be executed. 

>  In everything I've learned so far, both 0 values and empty strings are false values. An empty string is a quote without any characters inside. For example, "" is an empty string. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574594121
 ```  
The program output is: 

x+y=4

x+y=2

x+y=0 

Code explanation: 

>  The initial values of x and y are both 3, and the value of x + y is 6, so the value of x + y > 0 is true. In the while loop, the values of x and y are continuously reduced by -1. When the values of x and y are both 0, x + y = 0, then the value of the expression x + y > 0 is false, so the code in the loop body will not be run. 

![avatar]( 18519c1f9c5ce5f2d60d7655c52a0051.png) 

##  7.2.4 loop structure can be nested 

Loop structure, like conditional control structure, can also be nested. Similarly, pay attention to code indentation when nesting, and the depth of nesting should not be too deep, otherwise it will lead to poor readability of the code and difficult to maintain. 

Code example - calculate the sum of all composite numbers between 1 and 10: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574594121
 ```  
In the above code example, the for loop is nested in the while loop, and the while loop can also be nested in the while loop, and the for loop can be nested in the for loop. Students can change all the code examples above to the for loop structure to compare the difference between the use of the while loop and the for loop. 

##  7.2.5 knowledge points 

>  (1) Cyclic control refers to the repeated execution of a program through instructions

(2) Python uses for, while to implement loop control

(3) When break is used in a loop, it indicates an abnormal exit

(4) The else statement in the loop structure is used to define the operation after the loop exits normally

Python's built-in range type can be used to generate a sequence of integers

So far, we have learned about conditional control and loop control. In this section, we will learn about the last control structure in Python: turn control. Before learning anything new, let's review the definition of conditional control and loop control: 

Conditional control refers to the conditional execution of instructions in a program according to the value of the expression. Loop control refers to making program instructions execute continuously and repeatedly 

Understanding steering control can be understood from its literal meaning. Steering means reversing the direction, and controlling the execution of the code through steering control during the execution of the program. In the content of Section 7.2, steering control has actually been touched. Exiting the loop through break is a kind of steering control. In Python, steering control is realized through break, continue, and return, which will be explained in the following sections.

##  7.3.2 break - exit the entire loop 

Break means break and break. Breaking the cycle means ending the cycle. In layman's terms, break is the terminator of the cycle, similar to the T-800 robot. 

Code example - Terminate the loop if it is greater than 2020: 

Python

 ```  
Execute break to exit the loop, but only to exit the loop structure where break is located, without affecting the outer loop. 

Code explanation: 

(1) Use conditional controls in loops to determine the value sum_of_numbers variable points to

(2) If the value is greater than 2020, execute the break exit loop 

Code example - calculate the sum of all prime numbers 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957457682
 ```  
Code explanation: 

(1) In the inner for loop, exit the current loop when number is divisible by other natural numbers.

(2) If the inner loop system exits normally, indicating that it cannot be divided by other natural numbers, then it is a prime number.

(3) Exiting the inner for loop will not affect the outer for loop. 

##  7.3.3 continue- exit this cycle 

Compared with break, continue only exits this loop. Assuming that it needs to be executed a total of 5 times in the loop, using break in the first loop will not execute the remaining 4 loops. Using continue in the first loop will end the current loop, and the remaining 4 loops will still execute. 

Code example - calculate the sum of all odd numbers: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957457682
 ```  
Code explanation: 

(1) % is a remainder calculator in Python. If the remainder after the number is 2 is 0, it means it is an even number.

If it is even, the loop ends.

(2) If it is not even, then the code in the loop body continues to be executed to calculate the sum of all odd numbers. 

Code example - output an inverted triangle: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957457682
 ```  
The program output is: 

* * *

 * *

  * 

Code explanation: 

>  (1) According to the characteristics of the graphics themselves, find patterns

(2) Obviously, there are three rows and five columns in the inverted triangle. Use the * symbol and the space symbol to jointly output the triangle

(3) When the number of the column is equal to the number of the row in this cycle, the * symbol is printed, which can be found from the characteristics of the graph itself.

(4) Furthermore, the number of * in each layer of the inverted triangle is decreasing and centered, and the effective range of the printed * is within the range of the number of columns minus the number of the current row. In Python, both break and continue can only be used for loop structures. Using break in a loop means that it exits abnormally and does not execute the code in the else. 

##  7.3.4 return-exit function execution 

In programming languages, return is used to exit the execution of a function, usually returning a value to the caller of the function. About functions, we will explain in detail in Chapter 14. 

 For the definition and usage of keywords such as break, continue, return, etc., students can also look up in the interactive mode and will not go into details.

##  7.3.5 knowledge points 

(1) Steering control is generally used in loop structures and functions to control the execution of loops and functions. 

(2) Python implements steering control through break, continue, and return. 

(3) break is to terminate the entire cycle, continue is to terminate this cycle 

(4) return is used to exit the execution of a function, usually returning a value to the caller.

##  8.1.1 understand data types 

Data types are classified according to the properties and characteristics of the data itself. For example, odd and even numbers are a data type. In the data type of odd number, the elements in the data set are all odd, and the remainder after odd and 2 is 1. In the data type of even number, the elements in the data set are all even, and the remainder after even and 2 is 0. 

![avatar]( 96f981fb947fe227887ba8e34b4b0b2a.png) 

Data types are not limited to numbers. Anyone who can be converted into data form can define a type for it. Defining a type for data greatly facilitates human analysis and processing of data at the logical level. 

For a computer, there is no data type, it "sees" only binary, and the data type in a programming language is a logical concept defined to facilitate programmers' data processing.

In Chapter 11, we will introduce object-oriented programming, where we can build a data model through the semantics of objects, and we can customize data types. 

##  8.1.2 Data Types in Python 

Data types in Python are mainly divided into simple data types and composite data types. 

>  Simple data types are basic data types that can no longer be divided. Composite data types, on the other hand, can be composed of simple data types. 

The simple data types in Python are integers, floating-point types, and boolean types. Integers are what we often call integers. Floating-point types are those with decimal points. Boolean types are used to represent logically true and false. Compound data types in Python include string, list, tuple, dictionary, set, and class types, which will be explained separately in subsequent tutorials. In this section, we will thoroughly master the simple data types in Python. 

##  8.1.3 simple data types 

Data types have their own specific type names. In Python, you can output the type name of the data type through the built-in type type. basic usage of type: 

type(object) 

When you execute a type function, you can pass a value or variable name through the parameter object to output the corresponding type name. 

(1) Integer type 

Integer types are commonly referred to as integers, such as negative integers, positive integers, and 0. Now please enter the interactive mode of Python and output the type name of the data through the type type. 

> >> type(2020)

<class 'int'> 

In interactive mode, you can see the output of < class'int '>, with the type name of the data enclosed in single quotes. 

 Class has the meaning of class, category, and data types are defined in Python through the class keyword. 

We continue to verify the type names of other integers in interactive mode. 

> >> type(0)

<class 'int'>

> >> type(-1314)

<class 'int'> 

From the output of the interaction mode, we can find such a law. For integers, their type names are int. In the process of learning, it is a very effective learning method to continuously verify the input and output or logical concepts and find the laws of things in phenomena. 

(2) Floating point type 

Floating-point types are commonly referred to as decimals, with decimal points, such as 20.1314, 0.0. Likewise, the type name of a floating-point type can be output by type: 

> >> type(0.0)

<class 'float'>

> >> type(20.1314)

<class 'float'> 

A floating-point type in Python whose type name is float. When there is only a. sign at the end of the number, it is also a floating-point type. 

> >> type(0.)

<class 'float'> 

(3) Boolean type 

Boolean types are used to represent logically true or false. In Python, the True and False keywords are provided. The former is used to represent logically true values, and the latter is used to represent logically false values. Output the type name of the Boolean type in interactive mode: 

> >> type(True)<class 'bool'>>>> type(False)<class 'bool'> 

Boolean type in Python, whose type is called bool. Now write an example program using the simple data types described above. 

Code example - calculate the sum of all composite numbers between 1 and 10: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574597102
 ```  
The code in the above section implements the same function as the code examples in the 7.2.4 section. The main changes are as follows: 

>  (1) Change the outer loop to the for loop

(2) Define the variable is_composite_number as a Boolean type. In practical development, if you need to represent logical true or false, then it is more natural to use a Boolean type. 

0 values of integer and floating-point types are automatically converted to logical false values. In Python, True is used for true values, and False is used for false values. 

##  8.1.4 Special None Type 

There is a special None type in Python. None semantically represents the null data type. It is a singleton with a constant None value. None is a keyword in Python that indicates that the value is null. Now enter the interactive mode and see the corresponding type of None: 

> >> type(None)

<class 'NoneType'> 

From the output, the corresponding type of None is NoneType. In Python, the value of None is only equal to the value of None, and the Boolean value converted to None is False. 

##  Data Types of 8.1.5 Variables 

Variables are a container used to store data memory addresses. The type of a variable depends on the type of data the variable points to. We can also verify this in interactive mode: 

> >> data_type = 0

> >> type(data_type)

<class 'int'>

> >> data_type = 20.1314

> >> type(data_type)

<class 'float'>

> >> data_type = True

> >> type(data_type)

<class 'bool'> 

##  8.1.6 knowledge points 

>  (1) Data types are classified according to the nature and characteristics of the data itself

(2) The simple data types in Python are integer, floating-point, and boolean. The type of the integer is named int, the type of the floating-point type is named float, and the type of the boolean type is named bool. True in the boolean type is used to represent true values, and False is used to represent false values.

(3) Python also provides the None type, which semantically represents the null type.

(4) The data type of a variable refers to the type of value that the variable points to.

Learn Python 8.3.6 System 

##  8.3.1 understand data type conversion 

Data type conversion, as the name implies, is the conversion from one data type to another. The term "rounding" is often used to imply type conversion, that is, converting a floating-point decimal to an integer. 

![avatar]( f410f1a5e3c3bd78aece20d1d58c7149.png) 

In our daily lives, we often switch between various roles. In the enterprise, we are the boss or employee, at home, we are the husband or wife. We are polite to strangers, and we expose all kinds of bad temper to familiar people. This is also a type conversion. Type conversion can be said to be present all the time and everywhere. 

You need to have good expectations for life, although it is full of twists and turns and tribulations, don't forget who you are, but become what you want to be 

##  8.3.2 explicit type conversion 

From a literal perspective, explicit type conversion is the explicit conversion from one data type to another. In Python, explicit type conversion is achieved through the syntax of type name + (). 

Code example - round decimals: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515037
 ```  
Code explanation: 

(1) A floating-point variable of type money is defined in the code instance, and then the floating-point type is explicitly converted to an integer in the form of int (money).

(1) When converting an integer to a floating-point type, there is an extra decimal point after the number. For example, if you convert 201314 to a floating-point type, the converted value is 201314.0. 

Code example - Conversion between string type and numeric type: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515037
 ```  
Code explanation: 

>  (1) When converting a string type to a numeric type, explicitly convert the string type to a numeric type directly through int () or float ()

(2) For integers, the base of the conversion can be specified by the argument base in the explicit conversion of int (). When the number in the string represents decimal, the argument passed is 10.

  When the number in the string represents binary, the argument passed is 2. When the number in the string represents hexadecimal, the argument passed is 16.

(3) Convert numeric type to string type via str () 

When converting a string type to a numeric type, the content of the string must be a continuous legal number (decimal number, binary number, hexadecimal number, etc.), with space characters and plus or minus signs, and no other non-numeric characters. 

Code instance - string illegal conversion: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515037
 ```  
Code explanation: 

(1) string "20.1314 748" is not a consecutive number

(2) string "20.1314\ n" contains illegal characters 

##  8.3.3 implicit type conversion 

When using numeric types for numeric operations, data types with a small range are automatically converted to data types with a large range. Numeric types in Python: 

Boolean type, integer type, floating point type

Sort them by the size of the indicated range as follows: 

Boolean < integer < floating-point type

Code example - Implicit conversion of numeric types: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574515037
 ```  
Code explanation: 

(1) Data types with a small range are automatically converted to data types with a large range

(2) In the expression 1 + 1.0 + True, 1 + 1.0 is computed first according to left associativity, 1 is an integer, 1.0 is a floating-point type,

Integer 1 is automatically converted to floating-point type 1.0, and the result of 1 + 1.0 is 2.0. Similarly, 2.0 + True is equivalent to 2.0 + 1.0, with a value of 3.0.

##  Conversions 8.3.4 Other Types to Boolean Types 

Each data type has its corresponding false value, and all converted boolean types that represent false values are False. False values in integers are 0, false values in floating-point types are 0.0, false values in string are empty string, None type represents empty type, and Boolean types after null type conversion are False. 

In conditional control structures and loop control structures, the value of an expression is converted to a logical value, and if it is a true value, the corresponding code is executed.

##  8.3.5 Knowledge points in this section 

(1) Data type conversion refers to the conversion of one data type into another

(2) Data type conversion in Python includes explicit type conversion and implicit type conversion 

(3) 0 values of integer and floating-point types, empty strings, None types, etc. are converted to False Boolean types.
