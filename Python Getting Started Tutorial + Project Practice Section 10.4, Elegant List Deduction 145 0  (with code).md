##  10.4.1 What is a list derivation? 

List comprehension, also known as list parsing. List parsing, as the name suggests, is to parse a new list from an existing iterable object. 

>  Iterables we have learned so far are strings and lists. Iterables can be iterated through in a loop. During the iteration of the elements in the iterable, we can process the elements to generate a new list. 

Before explaining the basic structure of list derivations, students will first look at a piece of code that adds new elements to the list in a for loop: 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python

 ```  
In the above code, we determine whether the current element is odd in the loop, and if it is odd, add it to the list. To simplify the generation code of the list, we can use the list parser: 

Python 

 ```python

 ```  
List comprehensions are more concise and elegant than adding elements directly using for loops. Now let's go into detail about list comprehensions in Python. 

##  Basic structure of 10.4.2 list derivation 

The basic structure of a list derivation is as follows: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
The element represents the element traversed from the iterable object iterable. From its basic structure, it can be seen that the list derivation is essentially a for loop. Each iteration in the for loop inserts a new element into the list. 

>  The iterable objects we have learned so far are strings and lists. We will now create a new list based on these two iterable objects. 

Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
The basic structure of a list derivation is simple. We now extend it with nested for loops and conditional control structures. 

##  Complex structure 10.4.3 list derivation 

List derivation containing nested for loops 

The grammatical structure is as follows: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
Element represents a new element generated by elements x and y. iterable represents an iterable object. For ease of understanding, we can transform a list derivation with a nested for loop into a normal loop structure: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
(2) List derivations containing conditional controls 

The grammatical structure is as follows: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
Element is an element that is traversed from the iterable object iterable, and then logically judged by the if statement. If the element meets the conditions, it is added to the list. Also for ease of understanding, we can convert the list derivation containing conditional controls into a normal loop structure: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
Code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
(3) Complex list derivations with both nested for loops and conditional controls 

We can use both nested for loops and conditional controls in list derivations to combine them into more complex list derivations. 

Look directly at the code example: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```  
When students understand the list derivation, they can convert it into an ordinary loop structure for understanding. The complex list derivation in the above text is taken as an example, and the corresponding ordinary for loop code is: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957458804
 ```

 ```

>  (1) List derivation, also known as list parsing. List parsing, as the name suggests, is to parse a new list from an existing iterable object.

(2) A list derivation is essentially a for loop. Each iteration in the for loop inserts a new element into the list.

(3) In the list derivation, for loops can be nested, and conditional control can be performed, thereby combining into a more complex list derivation.
